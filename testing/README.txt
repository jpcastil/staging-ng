See index.html for the template for EACH challenge.
Much of what is there is default code (imports for libraries, etc).
Where the challenge code goes is noted LIKE THIS.
It boils down to CSS[<style>], JS[<script>], and HTML[<div class="container-fluid id="challenge"]. (The code for each is all contained in enclosing [tags]); 

In production, the challenges are given their own css and js file. The HTML is injected with jQuery. 
This testing section is really to play each game on their own. Just open the .html file with whatever challenge you want, and play!
